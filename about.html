           <p>Rietta Hotels is a very nice place for both business and private engagements. The environment is serene and neat, the staff are professional, the rooms are posh, tidy, and well maintained. I would recommend it for any body that can afford their premium services. The place is quite very busy but you might not notice because of the efficiency in service delivery. Won't be bad for weekend getaway even with the family.</p>
